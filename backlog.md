## Review Backlog

### PR #46 — the `optical:` half of the spacing rule is unenforced (2026-09-02)

- [ ] [debt] `src/styles.css` now states two rules: every on-scale spacing value goes through a
  `--space-*` token, and every off-scale one carries an `optical:` comment saying what sizes it.
  Only the first is mechanically enforced — `unconvertedSpacing()` inspects on-scale values alone,
  so an off-scale px with no comment passes silently. The rule decayed inside the very commit that
  introduced it (`.place-detail-name` shipped two unmarked raw px and three reviewers caught it),
  which is the evidence that prose alone will not hold it. Either add a guard that fails an
  off-scale px in a spacing declaration with no `optical:` comment on or above its line, or state
  the rule in `docs/conventions.md` and accept it as a convention — do not leave it asserted by an
  in-file comment nothing checks (source: contract QA + Codex + code-review on PR #46)
  — `src/ui/stylesheet-claims.test.ts`, `docs/conventions.md`

### Map auth-failure hook (follow-up, 2026-08-19)

- [ ] [debt] The auth-failure hook is registered after the map mounts, which assumes the v3 API calls `navermap_authFailure` post-construction rather than during script init. No vendor doc or captured trace establishes that ordering in either direction — verify against a deliberately rejected origin in a real browser, and move the registration only if the check shows the hook firing earlier (source: contest round on PR #7, unverifiable-from-repo) — `src/map/place-map.ts` *(deferred: needs a real browser on an origin the Naver key rejects)*

### `fetch_disclosures.py` walk — sanctioned gaps left by the positional stop (2026-08-25)

- [ ] [debt] Three limits QA reproduced on PR #23 and the contract sanctioned, none of them
  data-corrupting but all undocumented. (a) A target-month cluster sitting below two legitimately
  older pages — a late-publishing department — is missed and the run still exits 0, because
  `PAGES_PAST_TARGET` is 2 and the year guard sees the first cluster's correct stamp. (b) The
  repeat-page guard compares only the immediately preceding page, so a board clamping an
  out-of-range `pageIndex` to a *cycle* rather than its last page still walks to `--max-pages`.
  (c) A month older than everything the board carries, or a board whose 업무추진비 titles are all
  undated, never arms the stop and costs the full 200-page cap on both traversals. (a) is the only
  one that can lose data; consider documenting it in SKILL.md rather than widening the rule
  — `.claude/skills/knue-expense-collect/scripts/fetch_disclosures.py`,
  `.claude/skills/knue-expense-collect/SKILL.md`

### UI label pass — review findings left out of PR #24 (2026-08-25)

- [x] [debt] `·` now separates both the fields of a metadata line (`' · '`) and the parts inside one
  category (`displayCategory`), so a card reads `카페·디저트 · 청주시…`. Only the spaces distinguish
  the two roles. Pick a different field separator, or render the category as its own element
  — `src/ui/place-labels.ts`, `src/ui/top-places.ts`, `src/ui/place-detail.ts`, `src/ui/search.ts`
  *(done: the category is its own element now — the 업종 badge — so the two roles no longer share a
  separator)*

### Naver taxonomy is truncated to one segment before it reaches the browser (2026-08-25)

- [ ] [feat] `places.json` carries `category` as the *first* segment of Naver's taxonomy path, and
  the roots are inconsistent — the same kind of restaurant arrives as `음식점>한식` or as
  `한식>육류,고기요리`, so `음식점` (216 places) and `한식` (138) are one class split in two. The
  full path survives only in `review_candidates.csv` (111 distinct approved values). Publishing the
  second segment as a `subcategory` field would let the 업종 badge say `육류·고기요리` instead of
  `한식`, and could support a finer filter than the four kinds. Needs a schema change, a validator
  rule and a full re-collect, so it was ruled out of the UI batch that introduced the badge
  — `collector/build_places.py`, `collector/validate.py`, `src/data/types.ts`
